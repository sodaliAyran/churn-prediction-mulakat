## Data Science Project for Data Science Interview

I finished this project in *one day*.

To be fair, it should have took several hours but I was out of practice and
most of the questions were not the kind of things I used to do.

In the end I believe it was a nice challenge.

My only problem is I believe I failed somewhere in the date calculation and
it caused problems in the several stages of the problems but I'm not sure.

## Questions

1. Exploratory Data Analysis

2. Retention Calculation

3. RFM Analysis

4. Churn Prediction
